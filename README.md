## üéâ Installing / Getting started

In a browser with CDN usage :

```javascript
<script src="https://rawgit.com/WeiChiaChang/easter-eggs-mobile/master/scripts/easter-egg-mobile.js"></script>
```

Then add `class name` and `data-src` attribute on your `<a>` tags in your <b>HTML</b> file, take <b>Ghost</b> for example :

```html
<a class="gif-click gif-ghost" data-src='./images/ghost.gif'>Ghost</a>
```

 So if you want to use `pikachu`, that would be :
 ```html
 <a class="gif-click gif-pikachu" data-src='./images/pikachu.gif'>Pikachu</a>
 ```

 The rest of easter eggs follow this this way as well üéâ 

> You can ignore `gif-click` this class, just for CSS styling.

This table can help you find out easter eggs as required :
