## 🎉 Installing / Getting started

1. In a browser with CDN usage :

```html
<script src="https://rawgit.com/WeiChiaChang/easter-eggs-mobile/master/scripts/easter-egg-mobile.js"></script>
```

2. Or install with `npm` package :

```shell
npm i easter-egg-mobile -D
```

For `<b>Vue</b>` users, setup these commands in your single component file :

```javascript
import easterEggMobile from 'easter-egg-mobile'
```

And don't forget trigger easter eggs when it <b>mounted</b> already :

```javascript
export default {
  data () {
    return {
      ...
    }
  },
  // Trigger easter eggs when mounted
  mounted: function () {
    easterEggMobile
  }
}
```

The setting of JavaScript part all done, magic will show just still need a little bit addition on HTML, keep going! 💪 
---

Add `class name` and `data-src` attribute on your `<a>` tags in your <b>HTML</b> structure, take `ghost` for example :

```html
<a class="gif-click gif-ghost" data-src='./images/ghost.gif'>Ghost</a>
```

So if you want to use `pikachu`, that would be :
```html
<a class="gif-click gif-pikachu" data-src='./images/pikachu.gif'>Pikachu</a>
```

The rest of easter eggs follow this this way as well 🎉 

> You can ignore `gif-click` this class, just for CSS styling.

This table can help you find out easter eggs as required :
